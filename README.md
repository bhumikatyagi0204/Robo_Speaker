A Robo Speaker project involves creating a system that can convert text input into speech output. 
It typically utilizes text-to-speech (TTS) libraries in Python to generate synthetic speech from textual data. 
Users can input text, and the system converts it into spoken words, making it useful for applications like voice assistants or accessibility tools.
